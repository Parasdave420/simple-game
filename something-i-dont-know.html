    <h2>Don't know what should I name it:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Insecurities:</b> <br>You asked me about my insecurities. My biggest fear is losing someone/something I love. My family, future family, job, friends or myself.</li>
      <li><b>Shaant pani oonda:</b> <br>I don't have any other side. I am just a simple common guy. Or maybe a bit different but I don't have any dark side.</li>
      <li><b>Expectations:</b> <br>I know maybe I was expecting too much. Don't know su thayu. Again I felt like I am not able to identify what is going on in your mind.</li>
      <li><b>Pushing Boundaries:</b> <br>Maybe I was pushing too much. But I just wanted to know you better and see you smile / laugh. Tu kai rite joy handle kre che. Tu kai rite sadness handle kare che. Tu kai rite gusso handle kare che. </li>
      <li><b>Observations:</b> <br>Tame loko jyare ghare avyata tyare khali ek var tane sharmata joiti. I can be totally wrong kem k tu tari mummy jode kaik dal vada nu discuss kartiti and I heard it and just looked at you.</li>
      <li><b>Cluelessness:</b> <br>Bas avu ghanu badhu mare janvutu but badhu undhi direction ma jatu rahyu. Sorry for being so clueless.</li>
      <li><b>Stalking:</b><br>I was not stalking you. That was a light joke. Maybe that was also disrespectful.</li>
        <li><b>Confusion:</b><br>I often find myself confused about how to act around you. I just want to make people around me happy, but sometimes I don't know how.</li>
        <li><b>Blocking stage:</b><br>I understand that you blocked me for a good reason. It felt really cold, and honestly, I'm still struggling to process it — not just because you rejected me, but because we had good conversations before (or at least I thought so). This time, you didn’t even want to see my response, which makes me realize just how badly I must have messed up. But I get it. I probably deserve that.</li>
