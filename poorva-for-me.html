    <h2>What is Poorva for Me</h2>
    <p>Poorva is someone who has left a significant impact on my life. She is someone I deeply respect and admire. Her presence brings joy, and her thoughts inspire me to be a better person. Poorva is not just a name; she represents kindness, strength, and understanding in my life.</p>

    <p>Pan mara mate tu ek independant, caring, hard-working, thodik jolly (maybe because I am stranger) person che. Who cares about everyone around her(except topi people). Jene ungh sauthi vadhare vhali che. A keen observer, je thodik confused pan hoy che. Jene free time ma kaik meaningful karvu game che. And ha an awesome painter. Maybe tari painintings complete thayeli kyarey nai jova male (Bajrangbali and Krishna and have je pan tu karish e koi pan).</p>
    <p>Maybe I am living in complete / partial delusion, and you're not the person I think you are.</p>
